M120_HelloWorld

A Project with MVVM and WPF

This Project is spread across INF120 and INF226B, therefore including User Interface and objectorientated Programming as core themes.


This is a Clicker Game where you as an AI have to print as many "Hello World"s as possible. To reach that goal, you can buy Devices that print "Hello World" automaticaly. The more Devices you have, the more "Hello World" you print. And with more "Hello World" you can buy even more Devices!
